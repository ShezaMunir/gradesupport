### Title
The title should accurately reflect both the subject of the essay and provide a hint about the thesis or point of view. It should engage the reader’s interest and set the stage for the body paragraphs. A thought-provoking or interesting conclusion should tie everything back together and extend the thesis further.

**Excellent:** The title is engaging and reflective of the thesis, while the conclusion brings the essay full circle, enhancing the argument.  
**Satisfactory:** The title is present, but the introduction or conclusion may have some confusion or roughness.  
**Needs Improvement:** There is no title, and the introduction and/or conclusion may lack relevance to the body of the essay.

### Thesis/Focus
A strong argumentative thesis should be presented clearly in the first paragraph and remain the central focus throughout the essay.

**Excellent:** The thesis is clear, argumentative, and is consistently focused upon throughout the paper.  
**Satisfactory:** The thesis is clear but may not be consistently followed.  
**Needs Improvement:** The thesis is implied, absent, or poorly connected to the rest of the paper.

### Organization
Effective organization requires one main idea per paragraph, smooth transitions, and clear topic sentences. The order of the essay, as set in the introduction, should be followed consistently.

**Excellent:** The essay has clear and logical organization with effective transitions and topic sentences, and the structure follows the introduction’s order.  
**Satisfactory:** Organization is mostly clear, with some transitions and topic sentences, but connections between paragraphs might be weak.  
**Needs Improvement:** The organization is unclear, with missing topic sentences, rough transitions, and paragraphs that cover multiple ideas.

### Development

#### Support
The paper should use concrete details, examples, evidence, and relevant sources to substantiate and explain the thesis.

**Excellent:** Provides detailed, relevant evidence and references to support and explain the thesis thoroughly.  
**Satisfactory:** Provides adequate support, but some areas may be underdeveloped or unclear in connecting evidence to ideas.  
**Needs Improvement:** Lacks sufficient or relevant evidence, with little to no clear connection to the thesis.

#### Analysis
The analysis should explain how the evidence supports the thesis, discuss its significance, and explore its implications.

**Excellent:** Thorough, thoughtful analysis of the connections between evidence and ideas, with explicit discussion of their relevance and significance.  
**Satisfactory:** Adequate analysis, though some explanations may be incomplete or missing.  
**Needs Improvement:** Lacks thorough analysis, offering only basic or general conclusions without explaining connections between ideas and evidence.

#### Sentence Craft & Style
The essay should demonstrate the effective use of language, including varied sentence structure, precise word choices, and an appropriate tone.

**Satisfactory:** Language use is adequate, but some sentences may be awkward, and word choice may lack precision. Tone is generally appropriate.  
**Needs Improvement:** Language is vague or abstract, with improper word choices, choppy sentences, and inappropriate tone or style.

#### Grammar and Spelling
